## ChatApp 1.something.something

This is a **DELIBERATELY VULNERABLE** server based chat website. **DO NOT USE THIS SERIOUSLY.**

Hosting the go server will allow for communicating back and forth between any users that join the website. Anything can currently be sent across the network, meaning you can inject JS, HTML, and really whatever you want into the chatroom. This amounts to great fun when you are bored in class, and that is all it should ever be.

What this really is, is an experiment I used for learning about Server Sent Events in Go/Gin, and recieving them in HTTP/HTML environments.
